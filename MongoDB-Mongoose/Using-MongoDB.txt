- Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
> use my_first_db

- Create students collection.
> db.createCollection("students")

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
- Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
> db.students.insert({name: "Eric", home_state: "Hawaii", lucky_number: 8, birthday: {month: 07, day: 03, year: 1998}})  


- Get all students.
> db.students.find().pretty()


- Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
> db.students.find({home_state: "California"}).pretty()


- Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt:3}}).pretty()


- Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}}).pretty()


- Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
> db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number:{$gte:1}}, {lucky_number:{$lte:9}}]}).pretty() 


- Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
> db.students.update({}, {$set: {interest: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})                                                                                                                                             

- Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
> db.students.update({name: "Nick"}, {$set: {interest: ["coding", "cooking"]}})   


- Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
> db.students.update({name: "Dylan"}, {$set: {interest: ["coding", "gaming", "taxes"]}})   


- Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
> db.students.update({name: "Dylan"}, {$pull: {interest: "taxes"}})
        

- Remove all students who are from California.
> db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})


- Remove a student by name.
> db.students.remove({name: "Eric"}, true)


- Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
> db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

- Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
> db.students.update({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0 }} true)   


- Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
> db.students.update({home_state:"Washington"},{$inc:{number_of_belts:1}}, true)

- Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
> db.students.update({home_state:"Washington"},{$rename:{"number_of_belts": "belts_earned"}},true)


- Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
> db.students.update({},{$unset:{lucky_number:""}})


- Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
> db.students.update({},{$currentDate:{"updated_on":{$type:"date"}}})
